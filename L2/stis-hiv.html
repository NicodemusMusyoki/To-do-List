    <b>What it means: </b><br>
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help fight off infections. <br>  
AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body's<br>
immune system is severely damaged, making it vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers. <br><br>  
<b>Modes of HIV/AIDS transmission </b><br>
HIV is transmitted through specific bodily fluids: 
<ul>
<li>Semen:</li>
Semen contains a high concentration of HIV when an infected person has a detectable viral load.<br>
During sexual intercourse (anal or vaginal), the virus can enter the bloodstream of an uninfected person<br> 
through mucous membranes or small tears in the rectal, vaginal, or penile lining.<br>
<li>Vaginal fluids: </li> 
Similar to semen, vaginal fluids from an infected person can carry HIV.<br>
Transmission can occur during vaginal sex when these fluids come into contact with mucous membranes
<br>or breaks in the skin.<br>
<li>Breast milk:</li>
HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby through breast milk.<br>
This is why, in many parts of the world, where alternatives are available, it is advised that mothers that<br> 
are HIV positive do not breastfeed.<br>
<li>Unprotected Sexual Contact</li>
HIV is most commonly transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without using protection (e.g., condoms or pre-exposure prophylaxis).<br>
<li>Sharing Needles or Syringes</li>
Drug users who share contaminated needles are at high risk.<br>
<li>Mother-to-Child Transmission</li>
An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.<br>
<li>Blood Transfusions & Organ Transplants</li>
Although rare due to screening, receiving contaminated blood or organs can transmit HIV.<br>
<li>Occupational Exposure</li>
Healthcare workers can be exposed through accidental needle sticks or contact with infected blood.

</ul>

<p><b>Methods of HIV/AIDS prevention</b></p>

<p>1. Safe Sexual Practices:</p><br>

i. Condom Use:<br>
Consistent and correct use of latex condoms during every sexual encounter (vaginal, anal, or oral) is highly effective in preventing HIV transmission.<br>
ii. Reducing Number of Sexual Partners:<br>
Limiting the number of sexual partners decreases the risk of exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).<br>
iii. STI Testing and Treatment:<br>
Regular testing for STIs and prompt treatment can reduce the risk of HIV transmission, as some STIs can increase susceptibility to HIV.<br><br>

<p>2 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):</p><br>
i. PrEP Medication:<br>
PrEP involves taking HIV medication daily (or through injections) to prevent HIV infection in HIV-negative individuals who are at high risk.<br>
It is highly effective when taken as prescribed.<br><br>

<p>3. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):<br>
i. PEP Medication:<br>
PEP involves taking HIV medication within 72 hours of potential HIV exposure to prevent infection.<br>
It is used in emergency situations, such as after unprotected sex or needle sharing.<br><br>

<p>4. HIV Testing and Treatment:</p><br>
i. Regular HIV Testing:<br>
Knowing one's HIV status is crucial for prevention.<br>
Regular testing allows for early diagnosis and treatment.<br>
ii. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):<br>
ART effectively suppresses the HIV viral load in people living with HIV.<br>
When the viral load is undetectable, the risk of transmitting HIV to others is virtually zero (Undetectable = Untransmittable or U=U).<br><br>

<p>5. Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):</p><br>
i. HIV Testing During Pregnancy:<br>
Testing pregnant women for HIV is essential.<br>
ii. ART During Pregnancy, Labor, and Delivery:<br>
Providing ART to HIV-positive pregnant women significantly reduces the risk of transmission to their babies.<br>
iii. Safe Infant Feeding Practices:<br>
In situations where safe alternatives are available, avoiding breastfeeding can prevent transmission.<br><br>

<p>6. Harm Reduction for People Who Inject Drugs:<br>
i. Needle and Syringe Programs:<br>
Providing access to sterile needles and syringes reduces the risk of HIV transmission through shared injection equipment.<br>
ii. Substance Use Treatment:<br>
Addressing substance use disorders can help reduce risky behaviors.<br><br>

<p>7. Education and Awareness:</p><br>
i.Comprehensive Sex Education:<br>
Providing accurate information about HIV transmission and prevention is essential.<br>
ii. Raising Awareness:<br>
Combating stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS is crucial for promoting prevention efforts.
