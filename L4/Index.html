        <fieldset><p id="par">Overview about early pregnancies</p></fieldset>
        
        <fieldset><p>Globally in 2023, an estimated 13 per cent of <a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/02_Adolescentgirlsandyoungwomen.pdf">adolescent girls and young women</a> give birth before age 18.
             Early childbearing, or pregnancy and delivery during adolescence,can derail girls’ otherwise healthy
            development into adulthood and have negative impacts on their education, livelihoods and health.<hr/>
             Many girls who are pregnant are pressured or forced to drop out of school, which can impact their 
             educational and employment prospects and opportunities. Early pregnancy and childbearing can also have 
             social consequences for girls, including stigmatization and reduced status in the home and community. 
             They can also lead to rejection and violence by family members, peers and partners as well as early
             and forced marriage.
             
            <p id="par">Causes of early pregnancies.</p>
            <p>Understanding the causes of early teenage pregnancy is essential to formulating efficacious prevention
                 strategies and supporting vulnerable young individuals facing this challenge.</p><br>
               <br> <p style="color: black;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">1. Lack of Comprehensive Sex Education</p>
                Teenage pregnancy often arises from a lack of comprehensive sex education in schools and communities. Without 
                accurate and age-appropriate information on sexual health, contraception, and healthy relationships, young 
                people may engage in risky sexual behavior that results in untimely pregnancies. According to research by the 
                Guttmacher Institute, students who received thorough sex education had a 50% lower risk of becoming pregnant 
                early than those who did not.<br>
                <br>
                To address this problem, it is essential to promote thorough sex education programs that provide youth with 
                the information and skills to make mature choices regarding their sexual and reproductive health.
                The prevalence e of early adolescent pregnancies can be considerably decreased by implementing evidence-based 
                courses highlighting contraception and the necessity of deferring motherhood.<br>
                <p style="color: black;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">2. Peer Intimidation and Media Influence.</p><br>
                The impact of peers and the media cannot be understated regarding teen behavior and early pregnancies. Teenagers 
                are especially susceptible to peer pressure and may engage in sexual behavior before they are ready to fit in 
                or look more mature. Additionally, media portrayals of teenage relationships and pregnancies can romanticize
                 early parenthood, inadvertently contributing to the normalization of adolescent pregnancy.<br>
                 <br>
                According to a Common Sense <a href="https://www.formpl.us/blog/social-media-survey-questionnaire" >Media survey,</a> 47% of teenagers believe that media affects how their friends feel 
                and act about relationships and sex. It is imperia to develop awareness campaigns that critique idealized 
                representations of teen parenthood and highlight the realities of its difficulties to counter this influence.
                 Encouraging open dialogue between teenagers and their parents or guardians about media influence and peer 
                 pressure can also help shape healthier attitudes toward relationships and sexuality.<br>
                 <p style="color: black;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">3. Socioeconomic Factors</p><br>
                Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in early teenage pregnancies. Adolescents from low-income families 
                frequently have limited access to educational opportunities, healthcare, and resources, which can increase their
                risk of becoming pregnant at an earlier age. Financial hardship can sometimes drive teenagers to cohabit or
                 marry young, which raises the possibility of teenage pregnancy.<br>
                 <br>
                Teenage pregnancy rates and income levels are highly correlated in studies. Data from the National Campaign 
                to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and Unanticipated Pregnancy shows that teenagers from low-income homes had the highest
                 rates of teenage pregnancies. Comprehensive support systems are required to address this problem, including 
                 programs for young people to become economically empowered and access affordable healthcare and education.<br>
                 <p style="color: black;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">4. Absence of Parental Involvement.</p><br>
                The lack of parental involvement in teenagers’ lives can contribute to early pregnancies. When parents or 
                guardians are not actively engaged in their children’s lives, teenagers may seek validation and emotional 
                connection elsewhere, often leading to risky behaviors, including early sexual activity.
                According to study findings in the Journal of Adolescent Health, young people with more parental involvement 
                were less likely to become pregnant early. <br> <br>Thus, promoting open communication and maintaining supportive 
                relationships between parents and teenagers is crucial to lowering the number of early teenage pregnancies. 
                Parenting I initiatives that strongly emphasize communication, trust, and understanding can improve teen 
                decision-making and strengthen family ties.<br>
                <p style="color: black;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">5. Cultural and Societal Norms</p><br>
                The frequency of early adolescent pregnancies can significantly impact cultural and social norms. Early marriage 
                is regarded as the social norm in some communities, and teenage girls may be expected to take on adult roles and 
                responsibilities, including parenthood, at a young age.
                Child marriage is more common in areas with higher rates of early pregnancies, according to data from the World <a href="https://www.who.int/">
                Health Organization (WHO).</a> <br> <br>Fighting harmful cultural practices and advancing gender equality are necessary to 
                combat this. The cycle of early pregnancies can be broken, and a supportive environment can be created for teenage
                 girls to thrive by providing them with access to education, information, and opportunities.<br> <br>
                By addressing these multifaceted causes of early teenage pregnancies, we can create a more informed,
                supportive, and empowering environment for our youth, allowing them to make responsible choices and pursue 
                their dreams without the burden of early parenthood.
                
                <p id="par">How can we fight early pregnancy proliferation?</a>

        <h1>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis)">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),</a> previously known as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are infections spread through 
        sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. They are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites
        and can lead to various health problems if left untreated. Many STIs have no symptoms, making it crucial for
        sexually active individuals to get tested. 
        Treatment options vary depending on the type of STI, with 
        some being curable (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) and others being manageable 
        but not curable (e.g., HIV, herpes). </p>

        <p style="color: blue;"> Let us look at the general information on 
            STIs including transmission, treatmentand prevention of the common STIs</p><br>

            <h3>How STIs are Spread</h3>
            1.Sexual contact.<br> 
            
            Primarily through vaginal, anal, and oral sex. <br><br>
            2.Blood or bodily fluids.<br>Some STIs, like HIV, can be transmitted through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids.<br><br> 
            3.Mother-to-child transmission.<br>Certain STIs, like HIV and syphilis, can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. <br><br>
            
            <h3>Symptoms of STIs</h3>
            <p>Many STIs are asymptomatic, meaning people can be infected without knowing it.
            When symptoms do occur, they can vary depending on the type of STI and can include:<br><br>
            1.Discharge from the penis or vagina.<br>
            2.Painful urination.<br>
            3.Genital sores or bumps.<br>
            4.Itching or burning in the genital area.<br>
            5.Fever or swollen lymph nodes. <br><br>


            <h3>Importance of Testing</h3>
            Regular STI testing is crucial for early detection and treatment, especially if you are sexually active. 
            Testing can help prevent the spread of STIs to partners and reduce the risk of complications. 
            If you have any concerns about STIs, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional. <br><br>

            <h3>Prevention of STIs.</h3>
            1.Condoms.<br>
            Using condoms correctly and consistently during sexual activity can significantly reduce the risk of STIs.<br>
            2.Vaccines.<br>
            Vaccines are available for some STIs, such as HPV and hepatitis B, to prevent infection. <br>
            3.Abstinence.<br>
            Abstaining from sexual activity is the only way to completely avoid STIs.<br> 
            4.Monogamous relationships.<br>
            Having a sexual relationship with only one partner who has been tested and is free of STIs can significantly reduce the risk. <br>
            5.Limiting sexual partners.<br>
            Reducing the number of sexual partners can also lower the risk of exposure to STIs.<br> 
            6.Avoiding drug use.<br>
            Sharing needles when injecting drugs can increase the risk of STIs, including HIV and <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Hepatitis%20C%20&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=2&lq=0&pq=hepatitis%20c%20&sc=12-12&sk=&cvid=0D53DAC9E9CD4D35BB64658F7188D054">hepatitis C. </a><br><br>


            <h3>Treatment of STIs</h3>
            1.Curable STIs.<br>
            Many STIs caused by bacteria or parasites, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, can be cured with antibiotics or other medications.<br> 
            2.Treatable but not curable STIs.<br>
            Viral STIs like HIV, herpes, and HPV can be managed with medications that can reduce symptoms and prevent complications.<br> <br>

        <h1><b>Gonorrhea?</b></h1><br>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.<br> 
            It can infect both men and women and commonly affects the urethra, rectum, throat, and cervix. <br>
            If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to severe health complications, including infertility and an <br>
            increased risk of contracting HIV.<br>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="Pictures/G6.webp"alt="Health Education" class="cover">
            </div>
            <h4>Causes and Transmission</h4><br>
             Gonorrhea is transmitted through unprotected sexual contact with an infected person. This includes:<br>
            <ul>
        <li>Vaginal sex</li>
        <li>Anal sex</li>
         <li>Oral sex</li>
         <li>Sharing sex toys (if not cleaned or covered with a condom)</li><br>

         A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can pass the infection to her baby during childbirth, leading to <br>
         serious eye infections in the newborn. <br>
            
         <h4>Symptoms of Gonorrhea</h4>
         <p>Many people with gonorrhea do not show symptoms, making it easy to spread unknowingly. When symptoms do appear, they vary by gender.</p>
     
         <h4>Symptoms in Men</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Painful urination (burning sensation while peeing)</li>
             <li>White, yellow, or green discharge from the penis</li>
             <li>Swollen or painful testicles (though rare)</li>
             <li>Frequent urination</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h4>Symptoms in Women</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Increased vaginal discharge (often yellow or greenish)</li>
             <li>Painful urination</li>
             <li>Pain during sex</li>
             <li>Lower abdominal pain</li>
             <li>Bleeding between periods</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h4>Symptoms in Other Areas of the Body</h4>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>Rectal infection:</strong> Discomfort, itching, discharge, or bleeding</li>
             <li><strong>Throat infection:</strong> Often no symptoms, but may cause a sore throat</li>
             <li><strong>Eye infection:</strong> Redness, pain, or discharge (in rare cases)</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h4>Complications of Untreated Gonorrhea</h4>
         <p>If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious health problems, including:</p>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)</strong> – In women, it can spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing infertility or ectopic pregnancy.</li>
             <li><strong>Infertility in Men</strong> – Can cause epididymitis (swelling of the tubes near the testicles), leading to permanent infertility.</li>
             <li><strong>Increased HIV Risk</strong> – Having gonorrhea increases the risk of contracting and transmitting HIV/AIDS.</li>
             <li><strong>Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI)</strong> – If the bacteria spread through the bloodstream, it can cause joint pain, skin rashes, or even life-threatening complications.</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h4>Diagnosis and Testing</h4>
         <p>Gonorrhea is diagnosed through:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Urine test (for urethral infection)</li>
             <li>Swab test from the cervix, throat, anus, or urethra</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Doctors recommend regular STI screening, especially if you are sexually active with multiple partners or have unprotected sex.</p>
     
         <h4>Treatment of Gonorrhea</h4>
         <p>Gonorrhea is curable with antibiotics, but treatment must be completed to prevent reinfection.</p>
         <h3>Recommended Treatment:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>A single injection of ceftriaxone (antibiotic) in the muscle</li>
             <li>Oral azithromycin may also be prescribed to cover possible co-infections, such as chlamydia</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
         <ul>
             <li>Do not have sex until seven days after completing treatment to avoid spreading the infection.</li>
             <li>If symptoms persist after treatment, see a doctor immediately.</li>
             <li>Gonorrhea is becoming resistant to antibiotics, making early treatment crucial.</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h4>Prevention of Gonorrhea</h4>
         <p>You can reduce your risk of gonorrhea by:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Using condoms correctly every time during sex</li>
             <li>Limiting the number of sexual partners</li>
             <li>Getting regular STI tests, especially if sexually active</li>
             <li>Avoiding sharing sex toys without proper cleaning</li>
             <li>Ensuring both partners get tested and treated before resuming sexual activity</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h4>Gonorrhea in Newborns</h4>
         <p>If a pregnant woman has gonorrhea, her baby can develop severe eye infections. To prevent this, newborns are often given antibiotic eye drops immediately after birth.</p>

      <div id="syphilis" class="content">
        <h1>Syphilis</h1>
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium <i>Treponema pallidum</i>. It progresses in stages, each with distinct symptoms. If untreated, syphilis can lead to serious complications affecting organs such as the heart, brain, and nerves. Syphilis is often referred to as the "great imitator" because its symptoms can resemble those of other diseases.</p>
       
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Pictures/S1.webp"alt="Health Education" class="cover">
    </div>

    <h2>2. Causes and Transmission</h2>
    <p>Syphilis is caused by <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, a spirochete bacterium. It spreads through direct contact with syphilis sores (also known as chancres) during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Syphilis can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth (congenital syphilis), which can result in severe outcomes for the baby, including stillbirth or birth defects.</p>
    <p>Syphilis does not spread through casual contact like hugging, kissing, or sharing food.</p>

    <h2>3. Stages of Syphilis</h2>
    <p>Syphilis develops in four stages:</p>

    <h3>Primary Syphilis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The first symptom is usually a painless, firm, round sore (chancre) at the site where the bacterium entered the body (e.g., genitals, anus, mouth).</li>
        <li>This sore typically appears 3 weeks after exposure and can last 3–6 weeks.</li>
        <li>Even though the sore heals, the infection can remain in the body and continue to progress if untreated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary Syphilis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If untreated, primary syphilis progresses to secondary syphilis, which usually occurs 3–6 weeks after the chancre heals.</li>
        <li>Symptoms may include:
            <ul>
                <li>A skin rash, often on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet</li>
                <li>Mucous patches in the mouth, vagina, or anus</li>
                <li>Flu-like symptoms (fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat)</li>
                <li>Hair loss or patchy baldness</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>These symptoms can resolve on their own, but the infection remains in the body.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Latent Syphilis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Without treatment, syphilis enters the latent stage, where no symptoms are present.</li>
        <li>This stage can last for years. Some people may never progress beyond the latent stage, while others may develop tertiary syphilis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tertiary Syphilis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the most severe stage, occurring in 15–30% of people who do not receive proper treatment.</li>
        <li>Tertiary syphilis can damage internal organs, including the heart, brain, and nerves.</li>
        <li>It may result in:
            <ul>
                <li>Cardiovascular syphilis – affecting the heart and blood vessels, leading to aneurysms, heart failure, and damage to the aortic valve.</li>
                <li>Neurosyphilis – affecting the brain and nervous system, leading to headaches, visual problems, dementia, and even paralysis.</li>
                <li>Gummatous syphilis – causing soft, tumor-like growths (gummas) in organs and tissues.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Symptoms vary by stage and can be absent in the early stages (primary and latent syphilis), which is why regular testing is crucial.</p>

    <h3>Primary Stage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A single, painless ulcer (chancre) at the infection site, typically genital, anal, or oral.</li>
        <li>The chancre may go unnoticed, especially if located in the genital area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary Stage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A skin rash (often on palms and soles)</li>
        <li>Mucous patches (ulcerations) in the mouth, genitals, or anus</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Fever, sore throat, headaches</li>
        <li>Weight loss, fatigue, and muscle aches</li>
        <li>Condylomata lata (wart-like growths in moist areas)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Latent Stage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No symptoms are present, but the infection is still in the body.</li>
        <li>Can last for years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tertiary Stage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Damage to internal organs (heart, brain, nerves)</li>
        <li>Mental health changes (confusion, memory loss, personality changes)</li>
        <li>Cardiovascular damage (aortic aneurysms, valve failure)</li>
        <li>Gummas affecting tissues and organs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Syphilis can be diagnosed through laboratory tests, which may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blood tests (e.g., RPR, VDRL, FTA-ABS) to detect antibodies or the presence of the bacterium.</li>
        <li>Darkfield microscopy or PCR tests for the detection of <i>Treponema pallidum</i> from sores or lesions.</li>
        <li>Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) if neurosyphilis is suspected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regular screening is recommended for:
        <ul>
            <li>Sexually active individuals, especially those with multiple partners or high-risk behavior</li>
            <li>Pregnant women (to prevent congenital syphilis)</li>
            <li>Men who have sex with men (MSM)</li>
            <li>People diagnosed with other STIs</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>6. Treatment</h2>
    <p>Syphilis is curable with antibiotics, typically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Penicillin</b> (the preferred treatment, usually administered as an intramuscular injection). People who are allergic to penicillin can be given alternative antibiotics like doxycycline.</li>
        <li>The treatment is typically a one-time dose (for primary, secondary, and early latent stages) or a longer course (for late latent or tertiary syphilis).</li>
        <li>People who are treated should avoid sexual contact until the infection has been fully treated, and follow-up testing is recommended to ensure the infection is cleared.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Complications (If Left Untreated)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Infertility in both men and women due to damage to reproductive organs.</li>
        <li>Congenital syphilis – Transmission of syphilis from mother to baby during pregnancy, causing premature birth, stillbirth, or birth defects.</li>
        <li>Neurosyphilis – Brain and nerve damage leading to issues like paralysis, blindness, and dementia.</li>
        <li>Cardiovascular syphilis – Aneurysms, heart disease, or damage to blood vessels and the aortic valve.</li>
        <li>Gummatous syphilis – Destructive tumors in organs and tissues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Prevention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use condoms during vaginal, anal, and oral sex.</li>
        <li>Limit the number of sexual partners and engage in mutually monogamous relationships.</li>
        <li>Get tested regularly for syphilis and other STIs, especially if sexually active or having multiple partners.</li>
        <li>Avoid sexual contact if you or your partner have visible sores or rashes.</li>
        <li>Pregnant women should get screened to prevent congenital syphilis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Syphilis and Pregnancy</h2>
    <p>Syphilis can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or childbirth, resulting in congenital syphilis.</p>
    <p>This can cause serious health problems for the infant, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Premature birth</li>
        <li>Stillbirth</li>
        <li>Birth defects (e.g., deafness, blindness, bone deformities)</li>
        <li>Neurological damage (e.g., developmental delays, seizures)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pregnant women should undergo syphilis screening and receive treatment as needed to prevent these outcomes.</p>

        <h1>Genital Herpes</h1>
    
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is characterized by recurrent outbreaks of painful sores and blisters in the genital and surrounding areas. The infection is lifelong, as the virus remains in the body and can reactivate periodically.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Pictures/GH1.jpg"alt="Health Education" class="cover">
        </div>

        <h2>Causes and Transmission</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HSV-1:</strong> Traditionally associated with oral herpes (cold sores) but can cause genital herpes through oral-genital contact.</li>
            <li><strong>HSV-2:</strong> Primarily responsible for genital herpes and is transmitted through sexual contact.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The virus spreads through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person.</li>
            <li>Direct skin-to-skin contact with herpes sores.</li>
            <li>Asymptomatic shedding, where the virus is transmitted even without visible sores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Genital herpes is <strong>not</strong> spread through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Toilet seats</li>
            <li>Hugging or kissing (unless there is oral herpes involvement)</li>
            <li>Sharing food, drinks, or bedding</li>
            <li>Swimming pools or bathtubs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <h3>Initial Outbreak:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Painful blisters or ulcers in the genital, anal, or mouth area.</li>
            <li>Itching, tingling, or burning sensation before sores appear.</li>
            <li>Flu-like symptoms (fever, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches).</li>
            <li>Painful urination.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recurrent Outbreaks:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Less severe and shorter than the first outbreak.</li>
            <li>Triggered by stress, illness, hormonal changes, or a weakened immune system.</li>
            <li>Warning signs (tingling, burning) before sores develop.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical Examination – A doctor may identify sores or blisters visually.</li>
            <li>Viral Culture – A sample is taken from an active sore and tested for HSV.</li>
            <li>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test – Detects HSV DNA in a sample from a sore or blood.</li>
            <li>Blood Test (Serologic Testing) – Detects HSV antibodies, indicating past or current infection.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>There is no cure for genital herpes, but antiviral medications help manage symptoms and reduce outbreaks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Acyclovir (Zovirax)</li>
            <li>Valacyclovir (Valtrex)</li>
            <li>Famciclovir (Famvir)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These medications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorten the duration of outbreaks.</li>
            <li>Reduce the frequency of recurrences.</li>
            <li>Lower the risk of transmission to partners.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Condoms:</strong> Reduces but does not eliminate risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Sexual Contact During Outbreaks:</strong> The virus is most contagious when sores are present.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Antiviral Therapy:</strong> Helps reduce the risk of transmission for infected individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication with Partners:</strong> Discussing STI status and testing before sexual activity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Genital Herpes and Pregnancy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a pregnant woman has an active outbreak during childbirth, the virus can be transmitted to the baby, causing neonatal herpes, which can be severe.</li>
            <li>Cesarean delivery (C-section) may be recommended if active sores are present at the time of labor.</li>
            <li>Antiviral medications may be prescribed during pregnancy to prevent outbreaks.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        
        <h2>Causes and Transmission</h2>
        <p>Trichomoniasis is caused by <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, a microscopic, single-celled parasite that spreads through sexual contact.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vaginal intercourse with an infected partner.</li>
            <li>Sharing sex toys that have not been properly cleaned.</li>
            <li>Transmission from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth (rare).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trichomoniasis is <strong>not</strong> spread through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Casual contact (hugging, kissing, or handshaking).</li>
            <li>Toilet seats, swimming pools, bathtubs, or hot tubs.</li>
            <li>Sharing food, drinks, or personal items.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>About 70% of infected individuals do not show symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they typically develop within 5 to 28 days after exposure.</p>
        <h3>In Women:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Vaginal discharge: Frothy, yellow-green, or gray with a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Itching and irritation: In the vagina or on the vulva.</li>
            <li>Pain during urination or intercourse.</li>
            <li>Redness or swelling in the genital area.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In Men:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Discharge from the penis.</li>
            <li>Burning sensation after urination or ejaculation.</li>
            <li>Itching or irritation inside the penis.</li>
            <li>Mild discomfort in the urethra.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Complications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased risk of contracting or spreading HIV.</li>
            <li>Pregnancy complications: Preterm birth, low birth weight, or passing the infection to the baby.</li>

            <li><strong>Culture Test:</strong> A sample is grown in a lab to identify the parasite.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Metronidazole (Flagyl)</strong> – Single-dose or seven-day treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Tinidazole (Tindamax)</strong> – Single-dose treatment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important Treatment Guidelines:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Both partners should be treated to prevent reinfection.</li>
            <li>Avoid alcohol while taking metronidazole or tinidazole, as it can cause severe nausea and vomiting.</li>
            <li>Do not have sex until the infection is fully cleared (usually about a week after completing treatment).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use condoms during vaginal or anal sex.</li>
            <li>Limit the number of sexual partners and maintain mutually monogamous relationships.</li>
            <li>Get regularly tested for STIs if sexually active.</li>
            <li>Avoid douching, as it disrupts the natural balance of vaginal bacteria.</li>

       <p><b>What is HIV/AIDS?</b></p> 
       <p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells, 
        weakening the body's ability to fight infections. If left untreated, it can progress to AIDS 
        (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).</p> <br>

        <p>It can also be described as a virus that weakens the immune system, making it difficult to fight off infections and diseases. AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is the most advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely damaged. HIV can be spread through contact with certain bodily fluids, like blood, semen, and vaginal fluids, most commonly during unprotected sex or through sharing injection drug equipment. While there's no cure for HIV, effective antiretroviral 
            therapy (ART) can significantly slow the progression of the virus and allow people with HIV to live long, healthy lives. </p>
    
       <h2>Transmission</h2>
       <p>HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk. Common modes of transmission include:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Unprotected sexual intercourse.</li>
           <li>Sharing needles or syringes.</li>
           <li>Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h2>Symptoms</h2>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Acute Stage:</strong> Flu-like symptoms (fever, sore throat, rash, swollen lymph nodes).</li>
           <li><strong>Chronic Stage:</strong> Asymptomatic or mild symptoms.</li>
           <li><strong>AIDS Stage:</strong> Severe immune suppression, weight loss, opportunistic infections.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
       <p>HIV can only be confirmed through testing, including:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Antibody Tests</li>
           <li>Antigen Tests</li>
           <li>Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs)</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h2>Treatment</h2>
       <p>HIV is managed with Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), which:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Suppresses the virus.</li>
           <li>Reduces transmission risk.</li>
           <li>Allows individuals to live long, healthy lives.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h2>Prevention</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>Use of condoms during sexual activity.</li>
           <li>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).</li>
           <li>Avoid sharing needles.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h2>Global Impact</h2>
       <p>HIV/AIDS remains a global health challenge, but advancements in treatment 
        and awareness have turned it into a manageable chronic condition for many.</p><br>

            3. Advanced HIV Disease (AHD).<br>
            The CD4 T cell count drops to <i>200-349</i> cells per microliter, and the person may experience more serious 
            symptoms and illnesses. <br><br>
            4. AIDS.<br>
            The CD4 T cell count falls below 200 cells per microliter, and the person is highly susceptible to
            opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining illnesses. </P><br><br>

        1.No Cure<br>
        There is currently no cure for HIV, but ART can significantly improve the quality of life for people with HIV.<br><br>
        2.Undetectable Viral Load<br>
        With ART, many people with HIV can achieve an undetectable viral load, meaning the virus is so low that it cannot be detected in the blood. 
        This means they are unlikely to transmit HIV to their partners through sex. <br><br>
        3.Global Impact<br>
        HIV/AIDS remains a significant global health challenge, with millions of people living with HIV worldwide.<br><br>
        4.Stigma<br>
        Stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS can make it difficult for people to get tested, treated, and seek support.<br><br>
